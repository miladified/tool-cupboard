# Dunning Kruger

The Dunning–Kruger graph illustrates a cognitive bias where people with limited knowledge or skill in a domain tend to overestimate their abilities, while true experts often underestimate theirs. The curve typically starts with a steep rise in confidence after a little knowledge (the "peak of ignorance"), followed by a sharp drop as one realizes the subject’s complexity ("valley of despair"), and then a gradual, steady increase in confidence as real competence grows ("slope of enlightenment"). The takeaway is that recognizing one's own ignorance is the first step toward genuine learning and improvement.
